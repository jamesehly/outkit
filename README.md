#OUTKIT

Today there are a myriad of CSS and JavaScript frameworks that will practically build a website for you.  The result is that your site ends up looking and working just like any site built with those frameworks.  Outkit aims to be different, and while there are themes and defaults, its real power lies in how it allows components to work and talk together.  Think of Outkit as more of a component developing toolkit where you can mix and match the components to build the UX you want, rather than something prescribed for you.  If you are versed in JavaScript or TypeScript, writing Outkit components is a breeze.

Outkit is still very much in alpha so look for more to come.
